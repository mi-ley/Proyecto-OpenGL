![resumen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd61554-e9e3-4eb5-9631-1fe4e6010492) **Abstract:**   
The following project is an interactive 3D hide-and-seek video game aimed at children. The player controls a character in a room, exploring the environment and interacting with objects to discover hidden letters. These letters are scattered throughout the room, encouraging observation, curiosity, and problem-solving through a playful and immersive experience. In the development of 
this video game, we used the C++ programming language and the OpenGL graphics library, which allows us to manage the game logic and the three-dimensional visual representation of the environment.

![instalar-en-pc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aac9686-f793-4c76-a264-2f924af2d67e)  **Installer:**    



**1. Download the executable file.**  
Download the compressed package that contains the main executable file along with other necessary components for proper functionality.    
https://github.com/mi-ley/Proyecto-OpenGL/releases/download/5.9-beta.3/Find.The.World.zip

**2. Extract the executable file from the compressed package.**  
Once the download is complete, locate the compressed file (in `.zip` format). Inside the extracted contents, identify the executable file that will launch the application.

**3. Open the file named "proyecto".**  
After successfully extracting the files, locate the file named "proyecto". Run the file by double-clicking it. This file serves as the application's entry point and enables its core features.


![requerimiento](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11aec185-fcdc-4d28-8b72-447a8b212353)  **Minimum requirements:**
