![resumen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd61554-e9e3-4eb5-9631-1fe4e6010492) **Abstract:**   
The following project is an interactive 3D hide-and-seek video game aimed at children. The player controls a character in a room, exploring the environment and interacting with objects to discover hidden letters. These letters are scattered throughout the room, encouraging observation, curiosity, and problem-solving through a playful and immersive experience. In the development of 
this video game, we used the C++ programming language and the OpenGL graphics library, which allows us to manage the game logic and the three-dimensional visual representation of the environment.

 1. Download and Install Git
    - To begin, it is essential to download and install Git. If you are using Windows, you can access the installer via the following     link: https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

2. Create a Working Directory
    - Create a folder on your local drive where the repository will be cloned. This folder will serve as the central location for all project files
     
3. Initialize the Repository
   - Once the folder is created, right-click inside it and select the "Git Bash Here" option to open the Git Bash terminal in that directory. Then, run the following command to initialize the local repository:  git init

4. Clone the Remote Repository
   - After initializing the repository, proceed to clone the remote repository by executing the following command: git clone and next to the command paste the following: https://github.com/mi-ley/Proyecto-OpenGL.git

![requerimiento](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11aec185-fcdc-4d28-8b72-447a8b212353)  **Minimum requirements:**    

1. Hardware:
   - GPU: A graphics card that supports, at a minimum, OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile is required.
   - CPU: A modern processor is necessary; any CPU released in the last decade will meet the requirements.
   - RAM: A minimum of 4 GB is required, although 8 GB is recommended for optimal performance when loading complex scenes.
   - Disk Space: Approximately 100 MB is needed for the executable and its libraries. If the project includes numerous models and textures, an additional 200 MB is recommended.

2. Operating System:
   - Windows 10 or later.

3. Compilation Tools:
   - C++ Compiler: Visual Studio 2019 or 2022.
