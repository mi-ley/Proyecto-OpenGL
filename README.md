**Find the Word**

**Abstract:**   
The following project is an interactive 3D hide-and-seek video game aimed at children. The player controls a character in a room, exploring the environment and interacting with objects to discover hidden letters. These letters are scattered throughout the room, encouraging observation, curiosity, and problem-solving through a playful and immersive experience. In the development of 
this video game, we used the C++ programming language and the OpenGL graphics library, which allows us to manage the game logic and the three-dimensional visual representation of the environment.
